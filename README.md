Good evening.

Apologies for the slight delay. Following our call earlier, I’ve gathered the required data regarding MI00420 and the subsequent referrals to other orthopaedic/trauma specialists.

I’ve attached the analysis along with an Excel file containing:

Members who were treated by MI00420 with treatment dates

Follow-up consultations with any other orthopaedic/trauma specialist

Procedure codes, treatment dates, and patient-level details for all follow-up cases

Year-on-year comparison showing how many patients went on to see another orthopaedic specialist after MI00420

Percentage of onward referrals for each year (2021–2025)

Summary of Findings:
• MI00420 treated 370 members between 2021–2025.
• 30 members (8.1%) went on to see another orthopaedic/trauma specialist afterwards.
• The annual referral percentage ranged between 4.6% and 10%, as shown in the summary table in the report.
• Line-by-line details are included in the attached Excel for your review.

Please let me know if you would like this broken down further (e.g., by procedure type, hospital group, speciality, or by referral timelines). Happy to refine or extend the analysis as needed.
